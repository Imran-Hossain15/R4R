## Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

I found the container & docker system helpful for sharing reproducible code with another researcher. I want to implement in my research to share my code with my lab colleagues so that they can implement it without any hindrance. 

## Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

Previously, I knew that containers could be used with SQL for similar database environments. However, after this session, I am interested in learning more about it. We generally produce code for our environmental exposure assessment and share it
with our labmates to run the code and verify the accuracy. Most of the time, they face problems in their working environment to reproduce the result. The container and docker can help us overcome this problem for our research. 

## Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

The previous session was very insightful for me. Most of the topics were clear to me. I'm looking forward to the next session to learn more about it.
