### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.
The way to pre

The previous session introduced the hands-on aspect of building and running Docker containers, which I found exciting. The detailed breakdown of Docker commands like RUN, COPY, and CMD in 
a Dockerfile makes the container creation process far more accessible, and Iâ€™m eager to apply this by creating my research container. 
I am particularly excited to implement containerization in my projects to make data processing workflows more reproducible and accessible.

### Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

I'm looking forward to exploring multi-stage Docker builds. These could help streamline complex analysis pipelines, reduce container size, and improve efficiency in handling large environmental datasets.

### Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

Dockerfile syntax and command specifics can be challenging, especially when differentiating between CMD and ENTRYPOINT usage, which may need further clarification.
