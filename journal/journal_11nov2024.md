## Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

The session's most enlightening part was the comprehensive guide on accessing the HPC, focusing on the multi-step process. Furthermore, discovering how Apptainer 
facilitates containerized workflows without requiring root access was especially thrilling. This method streamlines the deployment of complex environments on HPC systems.

## Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

Iâ€™m looking forward to learning more about SLURM job scheduling. Mastering this will help me manage resources better and run larger experiments on HPC efficiently.

## Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

Navigating the various login nodes and understanding the full process, from bastion hosts to job submission on specific HPC systems like Ocelote and Puma, was challenging.
