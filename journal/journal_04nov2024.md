## Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. 

This could also be something you're excited to implement now.
I found CYVERSE very interesting to explore more for my research. I had a few experiences using HPC previously, but I found
it helpful after the last session, CYVERSE. I am excited to implement CYVERSE computing for my data analysis. 

## Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your current or future research projects.

I want to dig deeper into CYVERSE features and how to utilize them for big data analysis. I am currently working with big weather data. Sometimes it is hard to 
manage it on my laptop. Hopefully, CYVERSE will solve this issue. 

## Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here. Are there barriers that need to be overcome?

Until now, everything has been clear on this topic. However, exploring this topic might raise questions later.
